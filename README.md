In this exercise I am practicing of one of the
most important toolkits Python has for data cleaning and processing -- pandas.
I read in data into DataFrame structures, query
these structures, and the details about such structures are indexed.

Practicing how to merge DataFrames, generate summary tables, group data into
logical pieces, and manipulate data.
